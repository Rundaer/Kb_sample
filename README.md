Trying to create Prestashop modules using symfony. Currently I made dev branch where I work with basics and tests, when I'll have some kind of template ill post in on master branch. 

Don't know if I am right but I guess that it is better approach to create modules with SOLID and files/folders structure. It is not very complicated, I am just getting started!
